# gRPC Learning with C#

This repository contains my learning journey as I explore gRPC with C#. I'm documenting my progress, code samples, and experiments here.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a modern, open-source, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its interface definition language and data serialization format.

## Why gRPC?

gRPC offers several advantages over traditional REST APIs, including:

* **Performance:** gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, which provides significant performance improvements over HTTP/1.1.
* **Efficiency:** Protobuf serialization is more efficient than JSON or XML, resulting in smaller message sizes and faster transmission.
* **Type Safety:** Protobuf enforces type safety, reducing the risk of errors caused by data type mismatches.
* **Streaming:** gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, allowing for real-time communication between client and server.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

* **Examples:** Various gRPC examples demonstrating different features and use cases.
* **Experiments:** Code snippets and projects from my experiments with gRPC.
* **Notes:** My learning notes and observations on gRPC concepts.

## Getting Started

To run the examples in this repository, you'll need:

* **.NET SDK:** Install the latest .NET SDK from [the official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
* **Protocol Buffer Compiler:** Download the `protoc` compiler from [the official website](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).
